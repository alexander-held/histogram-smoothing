Python implementation of algorithm(s) for histogram smoothing. So far only implements the "353QH twice" algorithm, which is also used in ROOT's [`TH1::SmoothArray`](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/TH1_8cxx_source.html#l06723).
For reference, see [page 292 in these proceedings](http://cds.cern.ch/record/186223).
